QuickKey is an application I created with AutoIt to take text from the clipboard and save it to a hot-key combo. I needed it to do repetitive form filling. It’s written to be lean, quick and dirty. Here are the usage instructions:

---

  1. When launched for the first time, it creates and populates the “Clips” directory with it’s required files.
    * Hotkey: (CTRL + -) opens "Clips" in Windows Explorer.
  1. The hotkeys to save text from the clipboard are all “CTRL” + “SHIFT” + any number key or function key from the top 2 rows of your keyboard (total of 22 available saved clips).
  1. The hotkeys to use a saved clip is simply “CTRL” + the number or function key you used when saving that clip.
  1. Example: “CTRL” + “SHIFT” + “6″ saves text from the clipboard to the 6.txt file. “CTRL” + “6″ sends the contents of the 6.txt file. Its like pasting it, but its more like automated typing.
